## Approaches to Valuation

* Intrinsic Valuation : Assets with high and stable cashflow should be valued more than the assets with low and volatile cashflows.

* Relative Valuation : Compareative price of assets is based on earning and such similar factors is used to calculate value of the asset. For example company A has a price to earnings ratio(PE) of 0.5 and other Company B from the same sector has a price to earnings ratio of 0.4, the company B is a better value than company A as price relating to earning of B is lower than that of A.

* A hybrid approach is much more advised as it will always give better results and also lower risks.

### Some Truths about Valuation

* All Valuations are Biased : Be honest about your biases, spend less time with opinion pieces and more with account statements of the company, and put these biases down on paper when you start and try to make decisions.

* Most valuation are wrong : Uncertainty about a company's future prospect is a part of valuation. Refusing to value a certain company because of uncertainty does not make it go away, everyone else looking a the compnay has the same uncertainties. Collecting  more information does not always translate to reduction in uncertainty.

* Simpler can be better : Use the minimum amount of inputs that would be required to value a company, and create simple models. If a company can be value with 3 years of data, trying to analyze 10 years of data will only cause trouble and complicate the model.

* Start your Engine : Success in investing comes from being wrong less often than everyone else and not from being right all the time.
