# Procrastination Puzzle

> Teaching Talking Students Who Procrastinate by Tim Pychyl

## Understanding

"Hardwork often plays off after time but Laziness always gives now".
"If a job is worth doing now it is going to be worth doing tomorrow".

We dont think about our future self.

When we put things off we think that we will be having a lot of fun but we fill a huge amount of guilt.

"Tomorrow is a mystical land where 98% of all human productivity, motivation, and achievement are stored."

Procrastination is the gap between intention and action.
eg. If you need to do homework by Monday and it will need 1hr and you say that we will do it on Sunday. Not doing it on Saturday is not procrastination as we intend to do it at a later time.
But Sunday comes and I say that I will watch some TV for some time and do it later, then there is a gap between intention and action, thus this becomes procrastination.

Procrastination has direct and indirect effect on our health and also has effect on others around us.

Our deepest regrets are the things that we procrastinate and we did not do.

Procrastination is not about time management.

Procrastination is weakness of will.

## What is it that makes us Procrastinate

Procrastination is a habbit and we have to start at a place and then move slowly to get rid of it.

> "The mental discipline necessary to woek towards a deadline is somthing that you must develop. It can become habit just as letting things silde until the last minute can become habit. That pattern leads to staying up all noight and writing in a blind panic. Besides ruining your health you never can write your best. If anyone tells you, 'I have to wait until the pressure is on before I can start to cook', don't believe it. Occassionally, you maybe able to work under pressure of deadline, but stop kidding yourself, it won't be your best" \_ Hagen, 1990
